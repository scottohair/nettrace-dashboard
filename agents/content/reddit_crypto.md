# Monitor network latency to every major crypto exchange — free tool

Ever wonder which exchange has the fastest network connection from your region? I built NetTrace to answer that.

**20 crypto exchanges monitored in real-time:**
Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bybit, dYdX, Bitfinex, Gate.io, KuCoin, Gemini, Bitstamp, Huobi, Crypto.com, Upbit, Bithumb, MEXC, Phemex, WOO X, Backpack, Jupiter

**Scanned from 7 locations worldwide:**
Newark, Chicago, London, Frankfurt, Singapore, Tokyo, Mumbai

**What you can see:**
- Which exchanges have the lowest latency from each region
- When network routes change (BGP shifts)
- Latency trends over time
- Anomaly alerts when an exchange suddenly gets slower
