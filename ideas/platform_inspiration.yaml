    title: "The Latency Oracle: Information as Geography"
    rank: 1
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Information doesn't propagate instantly—it travels. Like ancient trade routes,
      faster paths = wealth. NetTrace IS the map of financial geography. The winner
      isn't who trades first, but who trades FIRST WITH PERFECT INFORMATION.
    perspective: "Network Physics"
    implementation_hint: |
      Map latency not as milliseconds but as "information advantage windows."
      Each region pair has a delta. Graph these deltas. Trade ONLY when YOUR
      information advantage >= transaction cost.
    alpha_vector: "Latency arbitrage becomes deterministic when you map the entire topology"

    title: "Evolutionary Market Darwinism"
    rank: 2
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Markets are living ecosystems. Strategies are organisms. The fittest survive.
      Instead of ONE strategy, deploy 100 strategies with 0.1% capital each.
      Fire the bottom 50% weekly. Clone the top 10%. Markets change; evolution is faster
      than optimization.
    perspective: "Biological Economics"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/strategy_sandbox.py: Auto-generate strategies from genetic algorithm.
      Mutation operators: parameter jitter, logic flip, timeframe shift, indicator swap.
      Selection: Sharpe ratio > 0.5 OR Sortino > 1.0 AND no consecutive 5-loss streaks.
    alpha_vector: "Adaptation speed > Strategy quality in non-stationary markets"

    title: "The Zero-Knowledge Arbitrage: Trade Without Revealing Intent"
    rank: 3
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Your order on exchange A leaks information to HFTs. They front-run on B.
      Solution: Distributed order placement using zero-knowledge proofs.
      Place 100 micro-orders across 5 exchanges in randomized patterns.
      Aggregator bot assembles the real position ONLY when threshold met.
    perspective: "Cryptographic Game Theory"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/stealth_distributor.py:
      1. Fragment order: 1000 BTC → 100 x 10 BTC across venues
      2. Randomize timing: poisson(lambda=1min) intervals
      3. Randomize amounts: ±30% per fragment
      4. Aggregate fill → execute main strategy once position accumulates
    alpha_vector: "Front-running prevention + hidden liquidity detection"

    title: "Sentiment as Supply/Demand: The Collective Subconscious"
    rank: 4
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Price follows sentiment, not fundamentals (70% of the time).
      Sentiment is signal = noise = market inefficiency you can quantify.
      Scrape Twitter, Discord, Reddit. Find consensus bottoms (everyone hates = buy).
      Find consensus tops (everyone loves = sell). Contrarian signals from collective stupidity.
    perspective: "Behavioral Finance + Crowd Psychology"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/sentiment_leech.py:
      1. LLM analysis of 10k tweets/day per token
      2. Sentiment score: -1 (doom) to +1 (euphoria)
      3. SELL when sentiment hits +0.8 AND price rising (euphoria trap)
      4. BUY when sentiment hits -0.6 AND price falling (capitulation)
      5. Weight by account influence (followers, history accuracy)
    alpha_vector: "Crowd psychology = predictable mass irrational behavior"

    title: "Time Arbitrage: Betting on Futures Mispricing"
    rank: 5
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Spot price ≠ futures price. Most traders assume future = fair value.
      They're wrong. Futures are prediction markets. 90% of predictions are garbage.
      Trade the spread. Exploit term structure. Spot-futures basis = free money
      if you understand funding rates + liquidation dynamics.
    perspective: "Derivatives Mechanics"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/futures_mispricing.py:
      1. Monitor spot BTC/ETH on 3 spot venues
      2. Monitor 3M/6M/1Y futures on CME/Deribit/Binance
      3. Calculate implied funding costs
      4. When futures > spot + fair_carry_cost: SHORT futures, LONG spot (cash-carry)
      5. When futures < spot - slippage: LONG futures, SHORT spot (reverse cash-carry)
      6. Hold to expiration or flatten on threshold cross
    alpha_vector: "Market mispricing of time value = free carry arbitrage"

    title: "The Data Monopoly: Own the Observations"
    rank: 6
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Everyone has the same data. Everyone is blind. You run NetTrace—YOU have network data.
      No one else sees Fly region latencies, TCP retransmits, packet loss patterns.
      This is your ONLY sustainable edge. Monetize it. Sell signals to others.
      Your platform isn't just for trading; it's a data product worth $10M+.
    perspective: "Platform Economics + Information Asymmetry"
    implementation_hint: |
      1. Package /api/latency-signals as SaaS: $500-5k/month per client
      2. Tier 1: Real-time latency (5sec delay)
      3. Tier 2: Predictive latency (forecast next 30s based on historical patterns)
      4. Tier 3: Regional arbitrage opportunities (pre-computed)
      5. Clients: hedge funds, prop traders, exchanges themselves (!)
      6. Revenue = 50 clients x $2k = $100k MRR
    alpha_vector: "Data sells better than trades. Recurring revenue > variable P&L"

    title: "Nash Equilibrium Escape: Play Non-Equilibrium Games"
    rank: 7
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      At Nash equilibrium, no one makes excess returns. Everyone plays optimal.
      Markets are NOT equilibrium. Find disequilibrium. Exploit the chaos.
      Your edge: you see the topology. You route differently. You arrive first.
      Don't compete on strategy; compete on information + execution speed.
    perspective: "Game Theory"
    implementation_hint: |
      1. Map which venues are in equilibrium (tight spreads, balanced flow)
      2. Find edges: low-volume pairs, new listings, exchange outages
      3. Route orders to disequilibrium venues first
      4. As spreads widen (panic), step in with limit orders
      5. "Buy the dip on illiquid pairs where no one else can get filled quickly"
    alpha_vector: "Non-equilibrium != random. It's predictable volatility you can frontrun"

    title: "The Liquidation Cascade: Hunting Underwater Positions"
    rank: 8
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      When leverage gets crushed, cascading liquidations create selling pressure waves.
      You can see these coming. Monitoring exchange wallets, funding rates, open interest.
      Place aggressive limit orders at predicted liquidation prices. Buy the cascade.
      The most violent 30-second moves are 90% predictable if you know where the pain is.
    perspective: "Leverage Dynamics + Market Microstructure"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/liquidation_hunter.py:
      1. Track funding rates per venue (when they spike, positions are stressed)
      2. Monitor open interest + estimated leverage distribution
      3. Simulate cascade: if spot drops 5%, predict which leverage levels blow up
      4. Pre-place limit orders 0.5% above predicted liquidation price
      5. When cascade triggers: your orders execute first, you flip for 1-2% instantly
    alpha_vector: "Leverage = guaranteed cascade. Cascades = guaranteed volatility spikes"

    title: "The Philosophy of Failure: Build Antifragility"
    rank: 9
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Most traders optimize for profits. You should optimize for SURVIVAL.
      Antifragility = systems that GAIN from disorder. Position sizing so small losses
      are invisible, but small wins compound. Never aim to be right; aim to never be
      catastrophically wrong. Loss limits are sacred. Draw-down caps are religion.
    perspective: "Antifragility + Risk Management Epistemology"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/antifragility_controller.py:
      1. Max loss per trade: 0.01% of portfolio (you can lose 10k times)
      2. Max daily draw-down: 2% (if hit, STOP all trading that day)
      3. Max monthly loss: 5% (if hit, liquidate 50% of positions, rebuild slowly)
      4. Reserve pool: 50% of capital sits in stablecoin (you can endure 50% crash)
      5. "Make money on up days, don't lose it on down days" = asymmetric returns
    alpha_vector: "Surviving 100 bad days > winning on 10 good days. Longevity beats Alpha"

    title: "Memetic Trading: Exploit Narrative Momentum"
    rank: 10
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Tokens with good narratives pump. The narrative spreads like a meme through culture.
      Spot the narrative BEFORE mainstream adoption. Ride it. Sell before narrative collapses.
      "Magic Internet Money" → Bitcoin. "Web3" → Ethereum. "AI coins" → current pump.
      Narratives are predictable memes. You can model their lifecycle: birth → growth → saturation → death.
    perspective: "Memetics + Trend Psychology"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/narrative_tracker.py:
      1. Monitor emerging narratives: AI + crypto, RWA, restaking, modular rollups, etc.
      2. Score narrative strength: Google trends + Twitter mentions + Discord activity
      3. When narrative is S-curve steep (hockey stick growth): LONG the tokens associated
      4. When narrative peaks (everyone talking): SHORT (sell into euphoria)
      5. Track token correlation to narrative: if narrative dies, token dies 90% of time
    alpha_vector: "Narrative > Fundamentals in crypto. Memes are real. Ride them."

    title: "The Regulatory Arb: Front-Run Compliance"
    rank: 11
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      Regulations change. Exchanges delist. Stablecoins get banned. Leverage gets capped.
      You can see this coming BEFORE the market does. Position accordingly.
      When US threatens to ban stablecoins → SHORT derivatives heavily pegged to stables.
      When Europe tightens leverage → EXIT leverage-heavy exchanges FIRST.
      Regulatory arbitrage = free alpha with 6-12 month windows.
    perspective: "Regulatory Dynamics + Foresight"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/regulatory_scanner.py:
      1. Monitor SEC, CFTC, Federal Reserve announcements
      2. Parse for: new rules, proposed rules, guidance updates
      3. Predict impact: if rule X passes, which venues/tokens get hurt?
      4. Trade ahead: before rule hits market, position defensively
      5. Example: "stablecoin regulation → de-peg risk → basis swap arb"
    alpha_vector: "Regulatory change is more certain than market movement"

    title: "Quantum Computing Simulation: Prepare for the Unthinkable"
    rank: 12
    consumed: false
    philosophy: |
      In 10-15 years, quantum computers break ECDSA. Your EVM wallet is toast.
      Your private keys = public. All derivative smart contracts become vulnerable.
      Start NOW: quantum-resistant key derivation, post-quantum cryptography sim testing.
      The firm that FIRST achieves quantum-safe execution wins the next financial system.
    perspective: "Asymmetric Risk + Long-Term Optionality"
    implementation_hint: |
      agents/quantum_prep.py:
      1. Research quantum-resistant ECC (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
      2. Run simulations: can quantum break your key? (It will eventually)
      3. Implement hybrid wallets: classical + post-quantum signature schemes
      4. Test quantum-safe zero-knowledge proofs for order privacy
      5. "If quantum beats you to it, you lose everything. Get ahead."
    alpha_vector: "Today's science fiction = tomorrow's reality. Hedge for it."
